# LIKE operator
	The percentage ( % ) wildcard matches any string of zero or more characters
	The underscore ( _ ) wildcard matches any single character.
	=> SELECT firstName FROM employees WHERE firstName LIKE 'a%';
		i.e Anthny,Andy
	=> LIKE '%on';
		i.e Patterson,Thompson
	=> LIKE '%on%'
		i.e Bondur,Jones,Patterson
	

# LIMIT
	select * from table_name LIMIT offset,rowcount
	offset start from 0
	
# Self Join
 => SELECT 
    CONCAT(m.lastName, ', ', m.firstName) AS Manager,
    CONCAT(e.lastName, ', ', e.firstName) AS 'Direct report'
	FROM employees e
	INNER JOIN employees m 
	ON 
	m.employeeNumber = e.reportsTo
	ORDER BY Manager;

i.e 
	SELECT t1.`name` as 'empname', t2.`name` as 'manager'
	FROM users t1
	LEFT JOIN users t2
	ON
	t1.`reportTo`= t2.`id`

	
# Having
	Having is used always with Group By
 => SELECT ordernumber,price AS total
	FROM orderdetails GROUP BY ordernumber
	HAVING total > 1000;

# ROLL UP
 =>	SELECT productLine, SUM(orderValue) totalOrderValue
	FROM sales GROUP BY productline WITH ROLLUP;

# PROCEDURE
	A procedure has a name,parameter list and SQL statement(s).It reduce network traffic
	and avoid us to write repetitive queries.
 =>
	DELIMITER $$
	CREATE PROCEDURE GetCustomers()
	BEGIN
		SELECT 
			*
		FROM
			customers
		ORDER BY customerName;    
	END$$
	DELIMITER ;
	
	Disadvantages: resource usage and troubleshooting

# TRIGGERS
	A Trigger is a stored program invoked automatically in response to a event like 
	insert, update or delete that occur in the associated table. i.e a trigger invoked
	before new row is inserted into a table.
 =>
	Create TRIGGER 
	[Before/After] [Insert/Update/Delete]
	ON table_name FOR EACH ROW
	trigger_body;
 =>
	CREATE TRIGGER before_employee_update 
    BEFORE UPDATE ON employees
    FOR EACH ROW 
	INSERT INTO employees_audit
	SET action = 'update', employeeNumber = OLD.employeeNumber, lastname = OLD.lastname,
    changedat = NOW();
		
# What is the main difference between MYISAM and INNODB ?

  MYISAM has table level locking while INNODB has row-level locking.

  MYISAM support FULLTEXT index while INNODB does not support FULLTEXT index.

  Performance speed of MYISAM tables has much better than INNODB tables.

  Innodb is better choice while handling larger database because it supports transactions.
  	
  MYISAM does not support transactions by table while INNODB does.
