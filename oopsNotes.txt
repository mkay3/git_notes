# Abstract Class Vs Interface

1. An abstract class can have access modifiers (public protected and private) but interface methods should always public and
  abstract.
2. Abstract classes have both abstract and non abstract methods but interface has just abstract method.
3. An interface is a contract. An interface defines what a class can do, without saying anything about how the class will do it.
4. A class can extend only one abstract class but can implement multiple interfaces. i.e An abstract class support single
   inhertience but a interface support multi level inheritence.
5. Interface does not contain data members. Abstract class contains data member.
6. Members of interface cannot be static. Members of abstract class can be static.
7. Abstract class can contain constructors while Interface does not contain constructors.
